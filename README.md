## DTC3DViewAnimation

This animation "push" a view according to a point (x and y) and relative to it's center. The angle depends on the distance from the center of the screen and can be set to a given max.

[Video demo](http://cl.ly/3y0o2z1v2U00) (Much more fluidity in real.)

## How
It's this block which does the trick:

```objective-c
void (^TransformAnimation)(CGPoint position, UIView *view, CGFloat maxAngle) = ^(CGPoint position, UIView *view, CGFloat maxAngle)
{
    CGFloat dx = position.x - view.center.x;
    CGFloat dy = position.y - view.center.y;
    // Get values for x and y axis
    CGFloat yTransformation = dx / view.window.frame.size.width;
    CGFloat xTransformation = -dy / view.window.frame.size.height;
    // Calculate the angle depending on the distance from the center
    CGFloat maxX = view.window.frame.size.width - view.center.x;
    CGFloat maxY = view.window.frame.size.height - view.center.y;
    CGFloat angle = (sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy) / sqrt(maxX*maxX + maxY*maxY)) * maxAngle;
    
    // Begin the transformation anim
    CATransform3D layerTransform = CATransform3DIdentity;
    layerTransform.m34 = 1.0f / -300; // perspective effect
    view.layer.transform = CATransform3DRotate(layerTransform,
                                               angle / (180.0f / M_PI),
                                               xTransformation,
                                               yTransformation,
                                               0);
};
```
